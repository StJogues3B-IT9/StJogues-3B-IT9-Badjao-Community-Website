			<p style = "font-family: Lexend Deca">Unhygienic food and water access is a serious issue in the badjao community. 
			These issues have been recognized as serious dangers to poor quality of life and human health. Due to the bad 
			sanitation in the Badjao community, access to clean food and water has become a major problem. All of the people of
			the Badjao community experience health issues like diarrhea, starvation, and even death as a result of the unclean environment. 
			Access to clean food and water are important because people can live well and have a decent quality of life if they have access 
			to these. The benefit of having access to healthy food and water is that it will enhance their quality of life and create a 
			happier, healthier community. By bringing communities together to help bring about change on issues, it raises and spreads 
			awareness. People can feel encouraged and motivated to act or make changes when they are aware.

			Pastor Felicisimo "Jun" Morales established Matina Aplaya Inc.'s Badjao Community Association. He and his wife spent
			more than 8 years living among the Badjao on Isla Verde, and he founded the group with the intention of "becoming a
			model among the Badjao community's inhabitants." From roughly 35 families when it first began, there are currently more 
			than 700 people there, divided among 174 households. With its activities and services, the institution succeeds in raising 
			the level of living in the Badjao neighborhood. Felicisimo Morales, the incorporation's creator, established it after 
			assisting a needy beggar and asked if there was anything further he could do. He and his wife Daisy made the decision to 
			go out to tackle the difficulties presented by the Badjaos and discover solutions to improve their standard of living. 
			They must discover how to manage their needs for food, water, clothing, cleanliness, and much more, but they manage. 
			Morales' perseverance allowed him to improve other people's lives. The ADDU JHS Community is one of the beneficiaries 
			of the Badjao community. In the past, Ateneo donated trash segregation supplies to the Badjao neighborhood in an effort 
			to keep the area clean. And this year, we are assisting the Badjao community in finding answers to their problems with 
			clean water and food.

		<h2>Context</h2>							
			<p style = "font-family: Lexend Deca">
			<h3> Mission </h3>
			<p> In order to improve people's lives, encourage sustainable development, and promote good leadership in the nation, the Badjao 
			community group collaborates with the government and industry. The goal of the badjao community's advocacy is to raise everyone's 
			standard of living. Our mission is to promote community issues' awareness, comprehension, and education.Lastly it is to spread 
			awareness and understanding in order to develop and maintain a healthy environment.
			<br/><br/> </p>
			
			<h3> History </h3>
			<p>The Badjao Community Association experience discrimination and self-fulfilling prophecy. They were tagged as slow learners, 
			have poor hygiene, and have low emotional quotients. Because of a language barrier, they have difficulty interacting with other 
			people and expressing their ideas and needs.
			<br/><br/> </p>
			
			<h3> Organizer</h3>
			<p> The Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc. was founded by Pastor Felicisimo “Jun” Morales. With his wife, he lived 
			with the Badjao in Isla Verde for more than 8 years, and with the purpose of “becoming a model among the populace of the badjao 
			community”, he established the association. It started with about 35 families, but now they have grown to more than 700 members 
			from 174 families. The institution aims to raise the Badjao community’s standard of living, and it does just that with their 
			programs and services.
			<br/><br/> </p>
			
			<h3> Beneficiaries </h3>
			<p> The founder of the incorporation, Felicisimo Morales, created it after helping a poor beggar and asking if he could do more. 
			He and his wife, Daisy, decided to go off and face the challenges of the Badjaos and find ways to make their lives more comfortable. 
			They have to figure out how to manage food, water, clothes, hygiene and so much more and yet, they are still able to manage. 
			Because of Morales' determination, he managed to make some people's lives better. 
            <br/><br/> </p>
			
            <h3> Benefactors </h3>
			<p> One of the benefactors of the Badjao community is the ADDU JHS Community. In the past, Ateneo provided the Badjao community with 
			waste segregation materials in order to preserve the cleanliness of their environment. And now, this year, we are helping the Badjao 
			community in their issues of clean water and food by researching solutions to this problem.

			<p> Shayndel is a vibrant individual. She isn't afraid to try anything. All I could think about is how strong and courageous she
			always appeared to be. She enjoys spending time with her friends but manages to balance her time with her family and friends as well as
			her studies. Although she can be immature sometimes, she can be responsible and serious when she needs to be.
			<br/><br/>

		<h3> Santino Espinosa </h3>
		 <img src="santinopic.jpg" class="webdesigner" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; opacity: 1;">
		 <p> Santino is loyal but can be unmotivated at times. He can just about do anything he wants to. He can be a little bit awkward at times.
		 But he's fine once you get to know him. He's barely serious about anything and rarely ever becomes actually serious. Though this means its
		 hard for him to be committed to most things that he wants or needs to.
